# Release notes

What changed in each version of TWS Labs, newest first. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): a new lab or feature is a minor version, a fix is a patch, and anything
that needs action from you (a new image, a changed setting, a Terraform apply) is called out under **Upgrade notes**.

To see what you are running, check `version` in `package.json`. Self-hosters: `git pull && ./start_local_labs.sh` rebuilds the image when it changed.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-06

### Highlights
- **Nine new labs on three new topics.** Docker, Networking and CI/CD with GitHub Actions are now live (19 labs in 6 tracks).
- **A passing Check now says so.** You get a short green confirmation, and failing checks keep the amber hint.

### Added
- **Docker** (3 labs): containers are just processes, writing a Dockerfile that builds fast, and layers, secrets and compose.
  There is no Docker daemon in the sandbox; the labs grade the files you write and real evidence from the sandbox itself.
- **Networking** (3 labs): IP addresses and CIDR, ports and sockets, and name to page (DNS, the Host header, TLS). Each session gets its own port,
  so two learners never collide.
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions** (3 labs): workflow anatomy, jobs, matrix and secrets, and OIDC to AWS.
- Optional `success:` text on a lab step, shown in green when its check passes (see `docs/authoring.md`).
- Check-script helpers in `labs/lib.sh`: `listening`, `http_code` and `yaml_get`.
- A new README: demo GIF, badges, a "Start here" table by goal, and a route table. `npm run readme:stats` regenerates the lab and task counts
  and the route table from the real catalog; a unit test fails if the README is stale.
- A 1280x640 social preview image (`docs/media/social-preview.png`).

### Changed
- The image now includes `jq`, `dig` (dnsutils), `ss` (iproute2), `nc` (netcat-openbsd) and `openssl`.
- Docker, Networking and CI/CD with GitHub Actions moved from "next" to live on the roadmap and the home map.

### Upgrade notes
- **Local:** rebuild the image once (`./start_local_labs.sh` does it for you). No settings changed.
- **Hosted:** the image changed, so the next push to `main` redeploys it through `deploy.yml`. No Terraform changes. The new labs were run end to end on the hosted
  profile after deploy (see `deploy/CHECKLIST.md`). The Networking labs use `bash`, `nc` and `openssl` servers rather than `node`, because learner shells run under the hosted address-space cap.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-01

First public release: Linux fundamentals, shell scripting, Git basics and the Elastic Beanstalk Cluster Mode lab, one lab server for
local (`docker compose up`) and hosted (Elastic Beanstalk Cluster Mode) use, MIT licensed.
